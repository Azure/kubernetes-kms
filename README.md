Azure KMS plugin for Kubernetes - Enable encryption of secret data at rest in Kubernetes using Azure Key Vault

**Project Status**: Alpha

>  ‚ö†Ô∏è  NOTE : Currently KMS plugin for Kubernetes does not support KMS key rotation scenarios. This means if you choose to create a new key version in KMS, the cluster will fail to decrypt as it won't match the key used for encryption at the time the cluster was created.

## How to use ##

### Prerequisites: ### 

üí° Make sure you have a Kubernetes cluster v1.10+, minimum version required that supports KMS provider.

### üéÅ acs-engine ###
We have added this feature to acs-engine so that you do not have to worry about any of the manual steps to set this up. Follow this [doc](https://github.com/Azure/acs-engine/blob/master/docs/kubernetes/features.md#azure-key-vault-data-encryption) and this [api model json](https://github.com/Azure/acs-engine/blob/master/examples/kubernetes-config/kubernetes-keyvault-encryption.json) to create your own Kubernetes cluster with Azure Key Vault data encryption. Once the cluster is created, you will see an Azure Key Vault and a key in the same resource group as your cluster. 

### üîú Azure Container Service (AKS) ###
This feature is coming soon to AKS.

### üõ† Manual Configurations ###

To see how to set this up yourself, you can follow the manual steps listed [here](./manual-install.md)

## Verifying that Data is Encrypted ##

Now that your cluster has `--experimental-encryption-provider-config` turned on, it will use the information provided to encrypt the data in etcd. 

1. Create a new secret

```bash
kubectl create secret generic secret1 -n default --from-literal=mykey=mydata
```

2. Using etcdctl, read the secret out of the etcd:

```bash
sudo ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --cacert=/etc/kubernetes/certs/ca.crt --cert=/etc/kubernetes/certs/etcdclient.crt --key=/etc/kubernetes/certs/etcdclient.key get /registry/secrets/default/secret1
```

3. Verify the stored secret is prefixed with `k8s:enc:kms:v1:azurekmsprovider` which indicates the azure kms provider has encrypted the resulting data.

4. Verify the secret is correctly decrypted when retrieved via the API:

```bash
kubectl get secrets secret1 -o yaml
```
the output should match `mykey: bXlkYXRh`, which is the encoded data of `mydata`.
