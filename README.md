# KMS Plugin for Key Vault

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/Azure/kubernetes-kms/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/Azure/kubernetes-kms/tree/master)

Enables encryption at rest of your Kubernetes data in etcd using Azure Key Vault.

From the Kubernetes documentation on [Encrypting Secret Data at Rest]:

> [KMS Plugin for Key Vault is] the recommended choice for using a third party tool for key management. Simplifies key rotation, with a new data encryption key (DEK) generated for each encryption, and key encryption key (KEK) rotation controlled by the user.

‚ö†Ô∏è **NOTE**: Currently, KMS plugin for Key Vault does not support key rotation. If you create a new key version in KMS, decryption will fail since it won't match the key used for encryption when the cluster was created.

üí° **NOTE**: To integrate your application secrets from a key management system outside of Kubernetes, use [Key Vault FlexVolume].

## Features

* Use a key in Key Vault for etcd encryption
* Generate keys protected by a Hardware Security Module (HSM)
* Bring your own keys
* Store secrets, keys, and certs in etcd, but manage them as part of Kubernetes
* Restrict access using Kubernetes core concepts: RBAC, Service Accounts, and namespaces

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

üí° Make sure you have a Kubernetes cluster version 1.10 or later, the minimum version that is supported by KMS Plugin for Key Vault.

### üéÅ aks-engine

[AKS Engine] creates customized Kubernetes clusters on Azure.

Follow the AKS Engine documentation about [Azure Key Vault Data Encryption] and refer to the [example cluster configuration] to create a Kubernetes cluster with KMS Plugin for Key Vault automatically configured. Once the cluster is running, there will be an Azure Key Vault containing a new key in the same resource group as the cluster.

### Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Azure Kubernetes Service ([AKS]) creates managed, supported Kubernetes clusters on Azure.

AKS does encrypt secrets at rest, but keys are managed by the service and users cannot bring their own.

## Verifying that Data is Encrypted

Now that your cluster has `--experimental-encryption-provider-config` turned on, it will encrypt the data in etcd. Let's verify that is working:

1. Create a new secret:

    ```bash
    kubectl create secret generic secret1 -n default --from-literal=mykey=mydata
    ```

2. Using `etcdctl`, read the secret from etcd:

    ```bash
    sudo ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl --cacert=/etc/kubernetes/certs/ca.crt --cert=/etc/kubernetes/certs/etcdclient.crt --key=/etc/kubernetes/certs/etcdclient.key get /registry/secrets/default/secret1
    ```

3. Check that the stored secret is prefixed with `k8s:enc:kms:v1:azurekmsprovider`. This indicates the Azure KMS provider has encrypted the data.

4. Verify the secret is decrypted correctly when retrieved via the Kubernetes API:

    ```bash
    kubectl get secrets secret1 -o yaml
    ```

    The output should match `mykey: bXlkYXRh`, which is the encoded data of `mydata`.
